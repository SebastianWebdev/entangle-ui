# Editor UI Toolkit

A specialized React component library designed for building professional editor interfaces. Built on [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/react/overview/quick-start) with TypeScript.

## Purpose

This library provides:

- **Editor-specific controls** - From basic inputs to complex editor components
- **Layout scaffolding** - Ready-to-use editor interface patterns
- **Minimalist aesthetic** - Clean, functional design inspired by professional tools

## Component Focus

### Core Editor Controls

- Advanced inputs (Vector, Color, Numeric with units)
- Precision sliders and dials
- Custom pickers (color swatches, gradient editors)
- Context-sensitive controls

### Layout System

- Dockable panels (left/right/bottom)
- Resizable split views
- Tabbed interfaces
- Customizable toolbars
- Status bar components

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Style

- Inspired by professional tools (Gaea 2.0, Blender)
- Neutral color palette with clear visual hierarchy
- Functional over decorative
- High contrast for readability
- Pixel-perfect alignment

### Technical Approach

- **Headless foundation** using Base UI
- **Composable architecture** - build complex editors from simple primitives
- **Performance optimized** for frequent updates
- **Type-safe APIs** with TypeScript
- **Themeable** core with CSS variables

## Target Use Cases

- Node-based editors
- 3D modeling tools
- Audio/visual editors
- Data processing interfaces
- Any application requiring precise parameter control

## Why This Library?

- Specialized for editor UIs (unlike general-purpose libraries)
- Battle-tested interaction patterns
- Consistent behavior across components
- Built by editors, for editors
